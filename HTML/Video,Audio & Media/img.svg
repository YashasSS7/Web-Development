# ✅ **What is `xmlns`?**

`xmlns` means **XML Namespace**.

A *namespace* tells the browser **what type of XML language** the file is written in.

Just like:

* `.html` → browser knows it's HTML
* `.css` → browser knows it's CSS

For **SVG**, we need to tell the browser:

👉 "This file uses SVG rules, not HTML rules."

---

# ✅ **Why do we need `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"`?**

Because **SVG is XML**, not HTML.
Without this namespace, the browser does not know it should interpret the tags (`<svg>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, etc.) as **SVG shapes**.

If you remove it:

❌ Browser thinks it’s unknown XML
❌ Shapes may not render
❌ `<img src="file.svg">` often fails
❌ Some browsers completely ignore the SVG

---

# 🧠 Think of it like this:

Namespaces prevent confusion.

For example:

```
<circle> … </circle>
```

This tag exists **only in SVG**, not HTML.
So the browser must be told:

👉 “Hey, these tags belong to the SVG language.”

That’s what the namespace does.

---

# 🔍 **Why that exact URL? (`http://www.w3.org/2000/svg`)**

It's NOT a website link.

It's just a **unique identifier** created by W3C that represents:

**“The official SVG language specification.”**

You don't visit it.
You just declare it.

---

# ✅ **Without the namespace, your SVG in `<img src="*.svg">` will BREAK**

This is exactly why your earlier image didn't load.

**Browsers require the namespace** for SVGs loaded as separate files:

```xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100" height="100">
```

If it’s missing → SVG inside `<img>` fails.

---

# ⭐ In summary:

### **What is it?**

The official identifier for the SVG language.

### **Why add it?**

Because browsers need it to understand and render SVG correctly — especially when loaded from files.


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->

The string xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" is called a **Namespace Declaration** (full name).

More specifically, the part http://www.w3.org/2000/svg is called the **SVG Namespace URL**.

---

# ✔ **Correct technical terms**

### **1. XML Namespace Declaration**

(what you write inside `<svg>`)

### **2. SVG Namespace URI**

(the value assigned to `xmlns` → the URL string)

### **3. Default Namespace**

Because it uses just `xmlns` (not `xmlns:prefix`), it becomes the default namespace for everything inside `<svg>`.

---

# Short Answer

👉 **It is called the SVG Namespace URI.**

If you want, I can also explain:

* Why it's a URI even though it looks like a URL
* What happens inside the browser when this namespace is parsed
