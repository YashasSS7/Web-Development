                    <div>` Element (Division)

* It is a **block-level** element.

* Used to **group larger sections** of HTML together.

* Usually for **layout** or **structuring** the page.

* Starts on a **new line** and takes up **the full width** available.

**Example:**

```html
<div>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I love coding and playing games.</p>
</div>
```

Here the `<div>` groups the heading and paragraph together — maybe later you’ll style this section with CSS.

**Think of `<div>` like a “box” or “container” for content.**

                      <span>` Element

* It is an **inline** element.

* Used to **style or mark small parts** of text or content.

* Does **not start on a new line**.

**Example:**

```html
<p>I love <span style="color: red;">pizza</span> and ice cream!</p>
```

Here, only the word **“pizza”** becomes red — the rest of the text stays inline.

**Think of `<span>` like a “highlighter” for text inside a sentence.**
