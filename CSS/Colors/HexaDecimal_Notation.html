<!--                                   Hexadecimal notation:
                                   
The hex code consists of a hash(#) symbol followed by six characters. These six characters are arranged into a set of three pairs (RR, GG, and BB).

Each character pair defines the intensity level of the colour, where R stands for red, G stands for green, and B stands for blue.

The intensity value lies between 00 (no intensity) and ff (maximum intensity).

Breaking the Character Set (RRGGBB):

RR: RR defines the intensity of color red, ranging from 00 (no red) to FF (maximum red).
GG: GG defines the intensity of color Green, with values from 00 (no green) to FF (full green).
BB: BB defines the intensity of color Blue, varying from 00 (no blue) to FF (full blue).

Syntax:
selector {
    color: #RRGGBB;
}
