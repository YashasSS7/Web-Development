<!--                                                               Outlines

An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, OUTSIDE THE BORDER , to make the element "stand out". 

It's commonly used for accessibility purposes, like highlighting focused elements.

Syntax:
outline: width style color;

-width: Sets the outline width.
-style: Determines the style of the outline such as solid, dotted, or dashed.
-color: Sets the outline color.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 1: Focused Button

.button:focus {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
When the button is focused, it gets a blue outline.


- .button targets elements with the class button.

- :focus is a pseudo-class that applies styles when the element is focused (for example, when clicked or navigated to using the keyboard with the Tab key).

- outline: 2px solid blue; draws a 2-pixel solid blue outline around the element.

- The outline is drawn outside the element, so it does not affect the layout or size of the button.

This is commonly used for accessibility, helping users identify which element is currently active or selected.

Example 2: Outline with Offset

.box {
  width: 150px;
  height: 80px;
  background: lightcoral;

  outline: 3px dashed black;
  outline-offset: 5px;
}
outline-offset :- The outline is placed 5px away from the element’s border.

Output:outline example

When you click or press tab on the button, a blue outline appears, showing that the button is in focus.
The second box has a dashed black outline with a gap (offset) between the box edge and the outline, making it stand out clearly.

4. Key Differences: Outline vs Border
While both can visually appear similar, outlines differ from borders in a few ways:

| Feature         | Border                       | Outline                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Position        | Takes up space inside layout | Drawn outside, doesn’t affect layout |
| Offset          | No offset property           | outline-offset can push it outward   |
| Width control   | Can vary on each side        | Always uniform on all sides          |
| Rounded corners | Works with border-radius     | No rounded corners (usually)         |
